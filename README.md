Reach Translation IO Agent
Reach Serial IO Agent Serial to QML Communication In order for your microcontroller to communicate with the QML Viewer
(a tool for loading QML documents that makes it easy to quickly develop and debug QML applications) 
messages being sent need to be translated. 
We have created a set of tools called the Serial Input/Output Agent (SIO) and 
Translator Input Ouput Agent (TIO) agents to make this translation happen.
